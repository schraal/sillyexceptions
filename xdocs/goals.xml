			<p>
        The goals of the silly exceptions project are:
        <ul>
          <li>Having fun coming up with silly exception names.</li>
          <li>
            Having fun with using these exceptions in our own programs and
            being ROTFL when encountering one of the exceptions in a stacktrace.
          </li>
          <li>
            Distributing the exceptions for a wider use, thus allowing more
            people to have fun with them. Also, others are encouraged to come
            up with new, silly exceptions.
          </li>
        </ul>
